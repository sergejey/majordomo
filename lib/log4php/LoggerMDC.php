 * The LoggerMDC class provides _mapped diagnostic contexts_.

 * A Mapped Diagnostic Context, or MDC in short, is an instrument for 
 * distinguishing interleaved log output from different sources. Log output 
 * is typically interleaved when a server handles multiple clients 
 * near-simultaneously.
 * 
 * This class is similar to the {@link LoggerNDC} class except that 
 * it is based on a map instead of a stack.
